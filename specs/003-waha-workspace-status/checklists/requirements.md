# Specification Quality Checklist: WAHA Integration and Workspace Status Gate

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-04-05  
**Feature**: [spec.md](file:///c:/Users/M/Desktop/AIagents/specs/003-waha-workspace-status/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The spec intentionally references existing file paths and collection names for continuity with Spec 1 and Spec 2. These references describe *what* already exists, not *how* to implement Phase 3.
- The spec boundary is clean: message processing (Phase 5) and knowledge ingestion (Phase 4) are explicitly out of scope.
- Constitutional compliance validated: Article IV (tenant isolation), Article V (serverless-first, fast webhook ack), Article VIII (HMAC + IP allowlist), Article IX (locale rules).
- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`.
